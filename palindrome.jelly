U‚Åº



Reverse the string, and do a "flat equal".




U=$E



Reverse the string, and compare it with the original one. The second argument of `=` is implicitly the original value.
We get an array of 1/0 (whether the element at N is the same as the one at length-N).
Use `$` to transform those two atoms into only a monadic one, then check that every element is equal (1).
(if we didn't use `$`, we'd get `U(v)=E(v)`, where `v` is the 1st argument)
